Python Coding Assignment from iCompaas

Hi John,

It was nice talking to you.

As discussed here is a coding assignment for you to implement in Python flask.
Once completed; share the Github repo link and set up a meeting to discuss your
solution.

Problem: Create a simple API in flask framework

Functionality: API that takes POST JSON payload
URL Path: /v1/sanitized/input/

POST Payload Example:
{
“payload”: “input"
}

Result: The API should return if the payload input has any characters that
could be used to do SQL injection.

Result 1:
{
“result”: “sanitized"
}

Result 2:
{
“result”: “unsanitized"
}

Good luck!
JP
